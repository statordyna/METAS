# METAS

ROS workspace with the code to run everything including evaluatory codes is added in in code/workspace, with details in the METAS.pdf.

Note: the code might not be working correctly due to the anonimization procedure.

## Instructions to install the repository:

We use ROS Noetic to build our package. Since METAS is developed using the iRotate package, we follow the same [installation instructions](https://github.com/eliabntt/irotate_active_slam/blob/noetic/INSTALL.md).

Other than the prerequites of iRotate, the following are required for METAS package to:

- numpy
- scipy
- grid_map ROS package (already in workspace, no need to install seperately)

after following the installation steps of iRotate, and installing all prerequites, we can build the workspace using:

```catkin build -DRTABMAP_SYNC_USER_DATA=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -j8```

## Running the METAS package:

The evaulation code is given in the METAS.pdf file. We provide tmuxinator config files, inside the ```tmux_config``` folder, to run all rosnode required together.

Example: ```tmuxinator start cafe_transformation.yml```, will run the METAS package on caf√© environment. Similarly ```tmuxinator start small_house_transformation.yml``` will run the METAS package on small_house environmnet.
